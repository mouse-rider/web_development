PHP also supports many databases, including MySQL.

After introducing the basics of the PHP scripting language, we discuss from pro-cessing and business 
logic, which are vital to e-commerce application. Next, we build a three-tier web application that 
queries a MySQL database. We also show how PHP can use COOKIES to store information on the client that 
can retrieved during future visits to the website. We revisit the form-processing example to demonstrate some of PHP's more dynomic capabilities.

PHP supports a larger number of major protocals such as POP3, IMAP and LDAP. PHP added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for to be as ffirst time.
