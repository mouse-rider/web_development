<h1>In this course,</h1> We will be covering the entire full stack web development, enabling each one of you to build an entire right website right form scratch.
<br>
We have several sections in our course and each section is organized based on the specific item
<br>
We shall begin the discussion by knowing the front end web technologies which includes
HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT and JQUERY
<br>
Then, we would teach PYTHON, DJANGO and SEQUEL that are required for the backend Web Development of the web applications.
<br>
Once we have mastered both front end and backend web technologies, we shall build some web applications.
<br>
Each section of our course has challenge tasks and some certain assignments for your practice purpose.
<br>
Now, let's get to know about the course and the syllabus
<br>
SYLLABUS:
HTML
CSS
BOOTSTRAP
JAVASCRIPT
DOM
jQuery
Python
Django
SQL
Sample Website Development
<br>
Before we proceed any further, we have to download and install some software's.
The software's we will be using in our entire program are as follows
1. Text Editor - ATOM TEXT EDITOR (OR) SUBLIME TEXT EDITOR (OR) VS CODE.
2. Web Browser - GOOGLE CHROME (OR) MOZILLA FIREFOX.
3. Anaconda Distribution - For creating virtual environments.
<br>
You can download and install sublime text editor from its official website givem below:
https://www.sublimetext.com
<br>
Once, you complete the above two steps, open the code you want to run and right click to see an option called open in browser.

<br>
Select that option to display your code result in your default browser.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that we have successfully downloaded and installed atom and google, let's proceed our discussion further.
Use any off the text editor and web browser of your choice.<br>
Even before we talk about web development, its timme for same general basic questions 
<br>
<em>What is the web?</em>
The World Wide Web, commonly known as th Web, is an information system Where documents and other web resource are identified by Uniform Resource Locators, which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.
<br><br>
<em>Why we use web?</em>
Web sefvices are a way to expose a functionality of your website to the outside world so that other applications can use it. Moreover, If you want some data from your web site to be visible to other devices like android or iOS then you can expose this data using web services and it can be consumend in android or iOS or Windows or any other platform fr that matter.
<br>
<em>How to develop website?</em><br>
Create a file for each page of the website using HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) that gives the content of the page . To do this, you will typically pay an Internet Service Provider (ISP) for web Hosting, and move your files to their server using FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

<br>
<em>Who invented website?</em>
Tim Berners-Lee<br>
The first web page went live on August 6, 1991. It was dedicated to information on the World Wide Web project and was made by Tim Berners-Lee. It ran on a NeXT computer at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN. The first web page address was http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html .
<br>

Now lets answer another intresting question <br>
How does the web work? <br>
So imagine what happens when you open your browser and try to visit a website?<br>
Let's breakdown the basic steps! <br>
Step 1:<br>
Usually one would type the URL of the website inside a default web browser to visit it.
www.selflearnwithus.com  
<br>
Step 2:<br>
Your local machine sends a request in form of a packets, which has the IP('Internet Protocol') address of the website you wantt to visit.<br>

www.selflearnwithus.com <br>
IP 123.456.789.10  ==>

![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/HTTP_RequestMessage.png?raw=true)

<br>

Step 3:<br>
Then a computer generally sends this request using wires using your ISP (Internet Service Provider).<br>

Step 4:<br>
Your ISp re-routes this request to the corresponding server location, using IP address as a guide.<br>

![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/server_responce.png?raw=true)<br>

<em>What is the server?</em><br>
Generally a server  is a device that provides seervices to other devices.<br>
In other words, devixes will request access to an HTML file form our server, and our serrver will return the HTML file to that device.<br>

![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/server.jpeg?raw=true)<br>

You might ghave seen the above picture of server in movies.<br>

<br>

Simple way to understand<br>
<em>What is the server?</em><br>
A server is a device that will accept the request and send back the responce to the user.<br>
<br>

Step 5:<br>
Once your request reaches the server, it can now send back the website you asked for.<br>
<br>

Step 6:<br>
But generally a complete website with so much content is very big in size to send as a single packet of data which is a problem.<br>
<br>

Step 7:<br>
To resolve this issue, the server will send back the website which is divided into many small packets of data.<br>
<br>

Step 8:<br>
These packets come with certain instrictions on how to get back to requested end user adn finally reassembles to display the website.<br>
<br>

Step 9:
These packets don't mind what path they follow to reach the final end user, but their objective is just reach the final location of request made.

![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/packet-switching.png?raw=true)<br>

Step 10:<br>
Once these packets reach the final end user, they are reassembled to show the requested web page in correct formate.<br>
<br>

Step 11:<br>
All of this process happens at speed off light (29 979 2458 m/s) 3Ã—10<sup>8</sup> m/s, so it happens extremely faster.<br>
<br>
<br>

Let's continue our discussion further by conversing what is ment is "Full-Stack"<br>
<br>
So, mainly there are two main components of any website <br>
1. The Front-End <br>
2. The Back-End <br>
3. Database Management <br>

<br>

The Front-End is what one sees as a final end user on the website.
<br>
The Back-End uses technology to display content on the Front-End.

<br><br>

The Front-End revolves around the following technologies:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery
5. Bootrtrap

<br>
Now let's start discussing the above technologies one by one.
<br>

First let's start our session by talking about HTML.<br>
<br>
![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/HTML.png?raw=true)<br>

~ HTML stands for - Hypertext Markup Language <br>
~ Every website will have HTML, it is the general structure of a page.<br>
~ HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.<br>
~ "Hypertext" refers to links that connect webpages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.<br>
~ Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other peole, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.<br>
~ That's a brief introduction about HTML<br>
<br>
<br>

Now, let's talk about the next lenguage CSS
![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/CSS3.png?raw=true)<br>

~ CSS stands for - Cascading Style Sheets<br>
~ CSS is the actual styling of website.(Most website have it)<br>
~ But even without CSS we can develop basic web apps but they wont look appealing.<br>
~ Colors, fonts, borders, and many more are all defined by CSS.<br>
~ CSS is not mandatory to have, but mostly all sites have it.<br> 
~ That is a brief introduction about CSS.<br>
<br>
<br>

Now let's talk about the next technology which is a very important one.<br>
And that is JavaScript makes the website responsive.

![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/javascript.png?raw=true)<br>
<br>
~ The reason I said JS is importsnt is that, the earlier two languages are static Unlike JavaScript <br>
~ The difference between stactic website and dynamic website is as follows <br>
~ static website are ones that are fixed and display the same content for every yser, usually written exclusively in HTML. <br>
~ A dynamic website, on the other hand, is one that can display differrent content and provide user interaction, by making use of advanced programming and databases in adding to HTML. <br>
<br>
~ JavaScript also allows you to add interactivity to a website, including the programming logic.<br>
~ Any site with interactivity uses JavaScript in some way or othrt, because otherwise the site is a "static" website.<br>
~ In the beginning of the course, we will discuss Front-End.<br>
~ The Front-End always uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript technologies.<br>
~ But we will also discuss BOOTSTRAP and jQuery<br>
~ On the other hand, as far as back end is concerned, there are so many options to choose from! <br>
<br>
<br>

~ The Back-End of any website generally has three mainly components:<br>
1. The Language <br>
2. The Framework <br>
3. The Database <br>
~ So many technologies such as PHP, Node.js, Ruby/Rails, Java, Python, etc. are all possible choices for any website. <br>
~ <em>So how do we decided which to choose form so many such options available?</em><br>
~ You are free to choose your own technology. But in this course, we use the below <br>
1. Python and php as the language<br>
2. Django as the framework<br>
3.  SQLite and MySQL as the Database<br>

~ The reason we chose Python is, it is a great language to learn, it's simple, powerful, and has many libraries.<br>
~ Similarly, the reason to choose Django is, it is the most popular framework for Python, it's fast, secure and scalable.<br>
~ SQLite, by default comes with Django and Python making it an easy choice.
~ But we will discuss other SQL databases as well in this course<br>
~ As we continue ,we shall be discussing each of these topics in detail.
<br><br><br>

<em>What is a programming language ?</em><br>
A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computer device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages <br>
<br>

<em>What isframework in web design ?</em><br>
In the world of web design, to give a more straightforward definition, a framework is defined as a package made up od structure of files and foldersof standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) which can be used to support the development of websites, as a basic to start building a site.<br>
<br>

<em>What is database ?</em><br>
A database is a structure that stores organized information. Most database contain multiple tables, which may each include several different fields. For example, a company database may include tables for products, employees and financial records.
<br><br>

~ I hope by you've got an idea about what is front end, backend development.<br>
~ As far as career is concerned, you can only be a front end developer<br>
~ You can only be a back end web developer<br>
~ Or you can also be a FULL STACK DEVELOPER by mastering both front end and back end and integration.<br>
~ Later we need to learn hosting and deployment<br>
~ Finally we will develop some web applications.<br>
<br>
<br>

~ Now, Let's discuss career opportunities of a full stack web developer.<br>
~ You can master front end first <br>
~ Then learn backend web development<br>
~ Finally learn about databases<br>
~ After you complete all the above steps, learn about hosting and deployment <br>
~ Build a few projects on your own to be ahead of the competition.<br>
~ In this course, I will discuss all the above mentioned topics.<br>
<br><br>

<em>What is ment by full stack development?</em><br>
A full stack developer is a web developerr or engineer who works with both front and back end of a website or application-meaning they can tackle projects that involve databases, building user-facing websites, or even work with clients during the planning phase of projects.<br>
<br>
<em>Why choose full stack web developer as a career?</em><br>
1. Huge Demand for Full Stack Developers<br>
2. Lucrative Remuneration<br>
3. Growth Prospects <br>
4. Diversified Job Oppertunities <br>
5. Easy to Learn<br>
6. Flexibility <br>
7. Get Hired By Best Employers <br>
<br><br>

<em>Domains of full stack web development:</em><br><br>
Having domain knowledge is more important than your technical skills while working for a corporate company. Below are some domains you will work<br>
<br><br><br>

~ Backend Architecture<br>
~ Mobile app Development<br>
~ Backend and Framework technologies<br>
~ Front-end technologies <br>
~ Database Technologies<br>
~ Cloud Services.<br>
~ Version Control System (VCS) and Debugging<br>
~ Devops<br>
<br><br>

<em>What is a domain?</em><br>
A domain is nothing but core knowledge of any particular sevtor, specific industry or nature of a business.<br>
Web developers should be effective at learning new business domains and be able to translate that knowledge into eliciting requirements.<br>
